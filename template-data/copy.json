Specifically, we want to ask how workers should train and be trained to most effectively switch jobs. In this context, discussions often focus on the somewhat drastic example of switching from blue-collar work to computer programming. While there are organizations doing great work to facilitate this switch, we wanted to use this example to ask: Is it really necessary for workers to move that far across the job landscape to avoid automation?"}],"all-automation":[{"type":"text","value":"Jobs with a high social component and a high number of non-routine tasks, like <span class=heavy-prose-blue-text>elementary school teachers</span>, are unlikely to become automated.
